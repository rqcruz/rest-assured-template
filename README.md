# Template for API testing automation with Rest Assured

## Welcome 🖐️

Hi folks! Welcome to my project **Template for API testing automation with Rest Assured**.

My name is Ronaldo ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronaldo-cruz-58b02ab)), I've been a QA for over 15 years and
I'm always looking for new knowledge and to improve those already acquired.

## About the project 💪 <a name="about"></a>

Whenever we want to start an automation project, we spend a considerable amount of time on its initial creation. So,
using this template, it is possible to start a project with the architecture and initial configurations already created.
<br/>

## Project structure 🗃️ <a name="structure"></a>

The project follows the structure below:

```

- `src/test/java/data`: classes that return objects to be used/serialized in requests.
- `src/test/java/requests`: classes that return methods that trigger requests. Each subfolder represents an API route.
- `src/test/java/runner`: classes that run the test suites. They can run a specific group or all the tests in the
  project.
- `src/test/java/specifications`: classes with the specifications and other request configurations.
- `src/test/java/tests`: test classes. Each subfolder represents the test suite for an API route.
- `src/test/java/utils`: classes with methods to provide auxiliary functionality that does not fit directly into a
  specific class.
- `src/test/resources/properties`: files with properties used by other classes.
- `src/test/resources/schema`: files with the JSON schemas of the requests to be used in the contract tests.

## Test naming patterns 📚 <a name="name-patterns"></a>

To maintain standardization in the naming of test classes, follow these rules:

- **Functional Tests**: They must contain the name of the route and end with `FunctionalTests`.

  > Ex: `LoginFunctionalTests` / `ProductFunctionalTests`

- **Contract Tests**: They must contain the name of the route and end with `ContractTests`.

  > Ex: `LoginContractTests` / `ProductContractTests`

- **Security Tests**: They must contain the name of the route and end with `SecurityTests`.

  > Ex: `LoginSecurityTests` / `ProductSecurityTests`

> ⚠️ **Attention:** This way, the tests are organized and easy to understand. In addition, the test suites were
> configured to run the tests that follow these nomenclatures.

## Run the tests 🦾⚙️ <a name="test-running"></a>

1. Clone of the repository.
2. Via IDE:
    - After importing the project, in the directory tree, go to `src/test/java/runner`.
    - Select one of the files `Run***.java` and run as `JUnit Test`.
3. Via command line:
    - Open the terminal.
    - Access the directory where the project was cloned, ex: `C:/Users/rest-assured-template`.
    - Run the command `mvn clean test`.

## Test Report 📊 <a name="test-report"></a>

After running the tests, the execution report is generated and can be found at:

*Local execution >*
`target/integrated-test-report/test-execution-report.html`

## Debug log 🔍 <a name="debug-log"></a>

We often need to consult the data generated by the request made, whether to fix a bug or even to validate whether the
request construction behaves as expected.

However, in order to avoid generating excessive data from the request body and response in the console log, a feature
was created that allows the developer to enable and disable the generation of this data as needed.

This function is located inside the class `specifications/RequestSpecificationSetup.java`

```java
enableRequestLog();

enableResponseLog();
```

To enable and disable logging, simply change the values of the variables `IS_ENABLE_REQUEST_LOG`
and `IS_ENABLE_RESPONSE_LOG` to `true` or `false`.

```java
private static final boolean IS_ENABLE_REQUEST_LOG = false;
private static final boolean IS_ENABLE_RESPONSE_LOG = false;
```
