# Template for API testing automation with Rest Assured

## Welcome 🖐️
Hi folks! Welcome to my project **Template for API testing automation with Rest Assured**.

My name is Ronaldo ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronaldo-cruz-58b02ab)), I've been a QA for over 15 years and I'm always looking for new knowledge and to improve those already acquired.

## About the project 💪
Whenever we want to start an automation project, we spend a considerable amount of time on its initial creation. So, using this template, it is possible to start a project with the architecture and initial configurations already created.
